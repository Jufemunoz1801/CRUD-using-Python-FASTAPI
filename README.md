# CRUD USING PYTHON & FASTAPI, HTTP METHODS

- Here, you will find a complete CRUD using **Python** and **FastApi**, we used HTML forms to ask the user for the information, for that we installed ***Jinja2***  

## Before to start
- Remember to create you ***VENV*** using `python -m venv folder_name`

- Also, install the libraries that we'll need.
`pip install fastapi`
